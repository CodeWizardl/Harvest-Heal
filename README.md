# Harvest-Heal üåø
#### Harvest-Heal is a user-friendly website employing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to offer crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, and plant disease predictions, empowering farmers to make informed decisions for enhanced agricultural productivity.

## MOTIVATION üí™
- Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the economic growth of nations, particularly in countries like India where a significant portion of the population relies on it for sustenance.
- Leveraging modern technologies such as ML and DL can revolutionize agriculture by providing farmers with efficient tools to optimize yields and mitigate risks.
- Harvest-Heal aims to address these needs by offering tailored solutions in the form of crop recommendations, fertilizer suggestions, and disease detection for plants.

## DATA SOURCES üìä
- Crop recommendation dataset: Custom-built dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset).
- Fertilizer suggestion dataset: Custom-built dataset accessible [here](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv).
- Disease detection dataset: Acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).

## How to use üíª
### Crop Recommendation System
- Input the soil's nutrient values, state, and city. Ensure the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Potassium) values represent their respective ratios. [This website](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm) provides further guidance.
- Note: Use commonly known city names as remote areas might not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for fetching humidity and temperature data.

### Fertilizer Suggestion System
- Provide soil nutrient contents and the crop you intend to grow. The system will identify nutrient deficiencies or excesses and recommend suitable fertilizers accordingly.

### Disease Detection System
- Upload an image of a plant leaf. The system will determine the crop type and assess its health. If diseased, it will identify the ailment and offer suggestions for prevention or cure.
- Supported crops:
  - Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Pepper, Orange, Peach, Potato, Soybean, Strawberry, Tomato, Squash, Raspberry.
